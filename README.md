#  ATS Microservice Project Structure 

This repository contains the codebase for BBSI Applicant Tracking System Microservice, following the N-Layer architecture pattern. 
This document provides an overview of the project structure and how different components are organized.

## Project Structure

The solution consists of following projects with dependencies:

- **Common Layer (`BBSI.ATS.Common`)**:
  - The Common project contains shared code, utilities, constants, and other resources that are used across multiple layers or projects within the solution. 
  - This project serves as a centralized repository for common functionality and helps in reducing code duplication and maintaining consistency across the solution.
  - Constants: Definition of constants or enumerations used across the solution.
  - Helper Classes: Utility classes containing helper methods or extension methods used by multiple components.
  - Dependencies: None
  
- **Domain Layer (`BBSI.ATS.Domain`)**:
  - This is the heart of the application. This layer defines the entities/models that represents business
  - Dependencies: None

- **DTO Layer (`BBSI.ATS.DTO`)**:
  - This layer defines the Data Transformation Objects that can be used for data transfer between different layers mainly between Web API & Services
  - Dependencies: None

- **Infrastructure Data Layer (`BBSI.ATS.Infrastructure.Data`)**:
  - This layer contains repository classes and database context responsible for interacting with the database.
  - Repositories encapsulate data access logic, such as querying and modifying entities.
  - Migrations include the migration scripts generated by EF core code first approach
  - Dependencies: Domain Layer, Common Layer

- **Infrastructure Integrations Layer (`BBSI.ATS.Infrastructure.Integrations`)**:
  - The Integrations project is responsible for managing integrations with external event bus services, such as Azure Service Bus. 
  -	This project facilitates communication and data exchange between our application and external systems or services, enabling 
    asynchronous messaging, event-driven architectures, and distributed communication patterns. This allows us to leverage the scalability, 
    reliability, and flexibility of event-driven architectures while decoupling components and promoting loose coupling between systems.
  - Dependencies: Common Layer

- **Service Layer (`BBSI.ATS.Services`)**:
  - This layer contains business logic and application services
  - Services interact with repositories to perform CRUD operations on entities, perform validation and orchestrate data flow
  - Dependencies: Infrastructure Data Layer, Infrastructure Integrations Layer, DTO Layer

- **API Layer (`BBSI.ATS.API`)**:
  - This project contains API controllers, request/response models and routing configuration.
  - Endpoints are defined here to handle incoming HTTP requests
  - Controllers interact with the service layer to perform business logic operations.
  - Dependencies: Service Layer


    The Integrations project/layer may include the following features and components:

   - Event Bus Clients: Integration with specific event bus services, such as Azure Service Bus using client libraries or SDKs.
   - Message Producers: Components responsible for publishing messages or events to the event bus for consumption by other systems or services.
   - Message Consumers: Components that subscribe to messages or events from the event bus and process them asynchronously.
   - Message Handlers: Logic for handling incoming messages or events, including deserialization, validation, and routing to appropriate handlers or processors.
   - Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms: Strategies for handling errors, retries, and dead-letter queues to ensure message delivery and reliability.
